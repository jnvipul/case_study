#### Project Structure
###### Root folder - case study
###### Contents
- model.ipynb - Jupyter notebook to improve the model
- Playground.ipynb(not important) - raw code for some EDA, experiments
- flask_app - folder for the self contained flask app which is running on http://35.198.192.192:4000/
- flask_app/data - contains the model file(model.joblib) and other precomputes.

NOTE : Not including model.joblib file as its huge. It can be found in the archive that I will be sharing in with email. You can copy that file in case_study/flask_app/data to run the flask app.
